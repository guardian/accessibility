## Testing your product with a screen reader

In the UK around [2 million people live with sight loss][sight-loss]. There are 350,000 people on the registers of blind and partially sighted people in the UK.

On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we want to ask you to fire up a screen reader and spend half an hour browsing one of our products. It could be theguardian.com, one of our apps or a product your team maintains.

If you'd like to give yourself a challenge, why not try our **Screen Reader Speedrun**:

- open [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com) in your favourite browser.
- set a stopwatch - use your phone, or [search Google for "stopwatch"](https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch) to bring one up in another tab
- fire up the screen reader software on your device (for instructions on how to do this, see "Getting started" below)
- see how fast you can navigate the most viewed article on the website today. The "Most Viewed" component usually appears toward the bottom of the page.

Once you have completed this, you can share your time in the [P&E/Accessibility space](https://mail.google.com/chat/u/0/?zx=tg6rca8mr6kx#chat/space/AAAAoMQI1jM)

### Getting started

For Mac users, the VoiceOver screen reader is built in to your laptop. WebAIM provides a useful guide to [testing accessibility with VoiceOver](https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/).

### What do we want you to take away from this?

What you take away will depend on your experience using screen reader software, and whether the product you test has been designed with screen reader users in mind ðŸ˜Š

- You will learn how to get started with a screen reader, some basic commands and how the software behaves
- You will experience how our digital products interact with the screen reader
- You may discover bugs or find frustrating aspects of the product design
- Hopefully, you will develop a better understanding of the mechanics and constraints of the screen reader experience, which will feed into the way you build software

Please take the time to read our [screen reader guidelines](../people-and-technology/03-visual.md#screen-reader).
