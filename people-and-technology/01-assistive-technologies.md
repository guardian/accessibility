# Assistive technologies

There is a variety of assistive technologies that help people with disabilities
navigate the digital space. It is important to keep these technologies in mind
when designing and developing digital products. To help with this, it is worth
watching videos of people using these technologies. You could also try using
assistive technologies you are not familiar with as part of your daily routine.

Where possible, you should test the products you build using a variety of
assistive technologies.
